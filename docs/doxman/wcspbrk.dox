    __wcspbrk - `search a wide-character string for any of a set of wide characters`__

       The wcspbrk() function is the wide-character equivalent  of  the  strp-
       brk(3)  function.   It  searches  for the first occurrence in the wide-
       character string pointed to by wcs of any  of  the  characters  in  the
       wide-character string pointed to by accept.


    # Return Value

       The wcspbrk() function returns a pointer to the first occurrence in wcs
       of any of the characters listed in accept.  If  wcs  contains  none  of
       these characters, `NULL` is returned.
